# 🐍 LeetCode Python Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems written in Python.

I solve problems regularly to improve my skills in data structures, algorithms, and coding interviews.

## 📌 Notes

- All solutions are written in Python 3.
- Each file is named according to the Leetcode Problem Number and may include comments explaining the approach.
- I'm uploading them as I solve problems — no fixed structure.

## 🧠 Goal

To stay consistent with problem solving and track my progress over time.
